## Setup

You need Erlang/OTP 27 or later, Gleam 1.19 or later and rebar3 (install
via [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/) or [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/), which
read `.tool-versions`).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/arizona-framework/wisp_roadrunner.git
cd wisp_roadrunner
gleam deps download
```

## Workflow

Run these before every commit and before pushing. CI runs the same
checks:

- `gleam format --check src test`
- `gleam build --warnings-as-errors`
- `gleam test` (the HTTP/3 tests need a curl with HTTP/3, or Docker with
  `ROADRUNNER_GLEAM_H3_CLIENT=docker`)
- `gleam docs build`

## License

wisp_roadrunner is licensed under the [Apache License Version 2.0](LICENSE.md), for all code.

## Reporting a bug

wisp_roadrunner is not perfect software and will be buggy.

Bugs can be reported via
[GitHub issues: bug report](https://github.com/arizona-framework/wisp_roadrunner/issues/new?template=bug_report.md).

Some contributors and maintainers may be unpaid developers working on wisp_roadrunner, in their own time,
with limited resources. We ask for respect and understanding, and will provide the same back.

If your contribution is an actual bug fix, we ask you to include tests that, not only show the issue
is solved, but help prevent future regressions related to it.

## Requesting or implementing a feature

Before requesting or implementing a new feature, do the following:

- search, in existing [issues](https://github.com/arizona-framework/wisp_roadrunner/issues) (open or closed),
whether the feature might already be in the works, or has already been rejected,
- make sure you're using the latest software release (or even the latest code, if you're going for
_bleeding edge_).

If this is done, open up a
[GitHub issues: feature request](https://github.com/arizona-framework/wisp_roadrunner/issues/new?template=feature_request.md).

We may discuss details with you regarding the implementation, and its inclusion within the project.

We try to have as many of wisp_roadrunner's features tested as possible. Everything that a user can do,
and is repeatable in any way, should be tested, to guarantee backwards compatible.

## Submitting your changes

### Code Style

- run `gleam format`
- write small functions whenever possible, and use descriptive names for functions and variables
- comment tricky or non-obvious decisions made to explain their rationale

### Committing your changes

Merging to the `main` branch will usually be preceded by a squash.

Commit messages use a plain imperative subject line, with no
`feat:`/`fix:`/`chore:` semantic prefixes. Subject only, no body
unless the change genuinely needs explanation (a one-line subject
beats a paragraph of preamble).

While it's OK (and expected) for your commit messages to relate the
*why* of a given change, be aware that the final commit (the merge
one) will be the PR title, so make it specific. This also helps
automated changelog generation.

### Pull requests and branching

All fixes to wisp_roadrunner end up requiring a +1 from one or more of the project's maintainers.

During the review process, you may be asked to correct or edit a few things before a final rebase
to merge things. Do send edits as individual commits to allow for gradual and partial reviews to be
done by reviewers.
